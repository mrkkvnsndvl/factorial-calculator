# Recursion Example: Factorial Calculator

This is a simple Java project that demonstrates the use of recursion to calculate the factorial of a number. The program takes user input and computes the factorial using a recursive method.

## Features

- Takes user input for the number.
- Calculates the factorial using recursion.
- Handles edge cases (e.g., negative numbers).
- Built using NetBeans IDE.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mrkkvnsndvl/factorial-calculator.git
